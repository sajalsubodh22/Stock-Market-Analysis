# Stock-Market-Analysis
This is a simple data analysis on the Stock Market data of  Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple.

This is a part of my practice in the Udemy Course : Python for Data Analysis and Visualization.

This is done in Jupyter (IPython Notebook).

It uses Seaborn (v.0.8.0) for data visualisation.

Go through it and analyze my analysis!

Note - Comments are the most important part of the code as they contain the links of the websites i used for reference plus the thorough explanation of code.
Do read them carefully!
