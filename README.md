# Stock-Market-Analysis
This is a simple data analysis on the Stock Market data of  Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple.

This is a part of my practice in the Udemy Course : Python for Data Analysis and Visualization.

This is done in Jupyter (IPython Notebook).

It uses Seaborn (v.0.8.0) for data visualisation.

# Consists of Five Parts : 
1. Reading Stock Data of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon from Yahoo Finances (can be done from Google Finances as well).
2. Simple Moving Average method for Closing Price prediction.
3. Daily Return Analysis of stock price , computing Pearson r value (Correlation Coefficient) between daily returns of different companies. 
4. Risk Analysis
5. Value at Risk using two methods :

   ii. MONTE CARLO method using GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION.
